The variance is calculated as the average of the squared deviations from the mean, while the standard deviation is the square root of the variance. A higher variance or standard deviation indicates that the data points are more spread out from the mean, while a lower variance or standard deviation indicates that the data points are more tightly clustered around the mean.\n",

The range of Dataset 1 is 20 (90-70), while the range of Dataset 2 is 40 (100-60), indicating that the scores in Dataset 2 are more spread out. The variance of Dataset 1 is 62.5, and the standard deviation is 7.91, while the variance of Dataset 2 is 200 and the standard deviation is 14.14, again indicating that the scores in Dataset 2 are more spread out. Therefore, measures of dispersion such as range, variance, and standard deviation can provide valuable information about the spread of a dataset and help us better understand the distribution of data points."
