    "Statistics is a branch of mathematics that deals with the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data. It involves the use of quantitative methods to describe, summarize, and draw conclusions from data. Statistics is used in a wide variety of fields, including science, engineering, medicine, business, social sciences, and many others.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main branches of statistics: descriptive statistics and inferential statistics. Descriptive statistics involves the use of methods to organize and summarize data, such as measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode), measures of dispersion (variance, standard deviation), and different types of distribution (histograms, scatterplots, etc.). Inferential statistics involves the use of methods to make inferences or predictions about a population based on a sample of data. This includes hypothesis testing, estimation, and regression analysis."

If you want to describe how the marks are spread out , you could use the standard deviation as a measure of variability.\n",

    "- Regression analysis: Used to model the relationship between two or more variables.\n",

    "Inferential statistics are useful when you want to make predictions or inferences about a larger population based on a smaller sample of data. For example, if you want to determine if a new drug is effective, you could use hypothesis testing to compare the outcomes of a treatment group and a control group. If you want to estimate the proportion of a population that supports a particular policy, you could use estimation based on a sample of survey data."

However, the differences between the categories are not necessarily equal or measurable.

There is no true zero point in interval data. Examples of variables at the interval level of measurement include temperature (Fahrenheit or Celsius), IQ scores, and dates (measured in years or days from a certain point).\n",

Ratio variables can be ordered, and the differences between categories are both equal and meaningful.

Different levels of measurement have different properties, which affect the way data can be analyzed and interpreted.\n",

    "For example, if we have data on the favorite color of a group of people, we need to know the level of measurement of the variable to perform appropriate analysis. If the variable is measured on a nominal scale, we can only count the number of people who choose each color and calculate the percentage of people for each color. We cannot compute a mean or variance because nominal data have no natural ordering or hierarchy. On the other hand, if the variable is measured on an ordinal scale, we can rank the colors from most to least popular and compute the median or mode. However, we cannot assume that the intervals between ranks are equal, and we cannot compute a meaningful mean or variance.\n",
